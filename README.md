# TutorHub

A production-grade **tutoring marketplace** — students discover and book lessons; tutors manage a
calendar, bookings, and earnings. Built as a TypeScript monorepo with a Next.js SSR/PWA storefront,
a custom-Webpack React/Redux dashboard, an Expo mobile app, and a NestJS API exposing the same
domain over **REST, GraphQL, and gRPC**.

> Status: ✅ All phases (1–7) complete — see [Roadmap](#roadmap).
> API docs: [`docs/API.md`](./docs/API.md) · Storybook: `npm run storybook` · npm:
> [`tutorhub-slot-engine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tutorhub-slot-engine)

## Why this project

A full, real-world marketplace built to senior standards: clean architecture, documented APIs,
tests, CI, and an [AI-augmented workflow](./AGENTS.md). The booking/availability model mirrors
real scheduling platforms (timezone-correct slots, no-show handling, real-time updates).

## Architecture

```
 marketplace (Next.js)  ┐                       ┌ dashboard (React+Redux, Webpack)
 mobile (Expo)          ┴── GraphQL / REST ──►  │
                                                ▼
                                services/api (NestJS)
                              REST · GraphQL · gRPC
                                ├─ gRPC ─► notifications (Elixir)
                                └─────────► PostgreSQL (Prisma)
   real-time: WebSocket events → dashboard (live bookings)
```

Per-phase build log and decisions: [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) and [`docs/`](./docs).

## Getting started

> **Built (Phases 1–7):** `packages/types`, `packages/slot-engine` (**published to npm**),
> `packages/ui` (RTL-safe components + Storybook), `packages/api-client`; the `services/api`
> NestJS API (Postgres + Prisma) exposing the domain over **REST, GraphQL, and gRPC** — with
> health/readiness probes, Prometheus metrics, and an **OpenAI booking assistant**;
> `apps/dashboard`, a React/Redux SPA on a custom Webpack build; `apps/marketplace`, a
> **Next.js 16** SSR/PWA storefront with an Arabic **RTL** locale and GPU-only animations;
> `apps/mobile`, an **Expo** student app; and `services/notifications`, an **Elixir/Phoenix**
> reminders service.

```bash
# prerequisites: Node 22+, npm, Docker (for Postgres)
npm install                                   # also generates the Prisma client
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test && npm run build   # full verification

# run the API:
cp services/api/.env.example services/api/.env   # set DATABASE_URL; never commit .env
docker compose up -d db                          # local PostgreSQL
npm run db:deploy -w @ermulaku/api               # apply migrations
npm run db:seed   -w @ermulaku/api               # sample data
npm run start:dev -w @ermulaku/api               # API + Swagger at :4000/docs
```

See [`services/api/README.md`](./services/api/README.md) for the full API guide.

## Built with AI

This repo is built with an **AI-augmented workflow** (Claude Code) under senior review — AI handles
mechanical work; architecture, correctness, and security stay human-owned. The approach,
verification checklist, security process, and a per-phase build log (what was built and **how it was
verified**) all live in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) as evidence.

## Documentation

- [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) — AI-augmented workflow, verification process & per-phase build log
- [`docs/API.md`](./docs/API.md) — REST / GraphQL / gRPC reference
- [`docs/schema.graphql`](./docs/schema.graphql) — generated GraphQL SDL
- [`docs/operations.md`](./docs/operations.md) — health, metrics & uptime ownership
- [`proto/booking.proto`](./proto/booking.proto) — gRPC contract

## Testing & CI

Every domain rule has a Jest test; core flows have Cypress E2E. GitHub Actions runs
lint → typecheck → test → build on every PR, plus a Lighthouse CI budget on the marketplace.

## Operations

The API exposes a liveness probe `GET /health`, a DB-checked readiness probe `GET /ready`,
Prometheus metrics at `GET /metrics` (process metrics + request rate/latency), and a small
self-contained status page at `GET /status`. See [`docs/operations.md`](./docs/operations.md)
for how I'd own uptime in production (probes, alerts, SLOs, dashboards).

## AI booking assistant

`POST /assistant/chat` is an OpenAI function-calling assistant: the model picks among
`searchTutors` / `getAvailability` / `bookLesson` and **the server executes** each via the same
service layer (validation server-side; the key never leaves the server). Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` to
enable it — unset, the endpoint returns `503`. Tests mock the model, so CI needs no key. In the
marketplace it surfaces as a **floating chat widget** on every page that also links back to the
relevant in-app pages (e.g. the pre-filtered tutor search) from its replies.

## Deployment

Shipped by four GitHub Actions on push to `master`: the **API** builds to a Docker image in
**Amazon ECR** and rolls out to **AWS App Runner** (via GitHub OIDC); the **marketplace**,
**dashboard**, and **Storybook** each deploy to their own **Vercel** project. The database is
managed Postgres (e.g. Amazon RDS). Full runbook — infra, env vars/secrets, migrations, and
wiring — in [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1** — Monorepo + `slot-engine` (tested) + CI + `AGENTS.md`
- [x] **Phase 2** — NestJS API + Prisma/Postgres + REST + Swagger
- [x] **Phase 3** — GraphQL + gRPC + API docs
- [x] **Phase 4** — Dashboard SPA (custom Webpack) + real-time
- [x] **Phase 5** — Marketplace (SSR/PWA, RTL, GPU animations) + UI/Storybook + Cypress
- [x] **Phase 6** — AI booking assistant + monitoring
- [x] **Phase 7** — Elixir notifications + Expo mobile + published slot-engine to npm
- [x] **Phase 8** — Tutor dashboard: 11 modules + onboarding, tutor auth, messaging, earnings/payouts, marketing, reviews & analytics (design-system themed)
